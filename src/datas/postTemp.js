                In September 2021, School of Sexuality Education published Sex Ed: An Inclusive Teenage Guide to Sex and Relationships. We’d been delivering sex and relationships education workshops in schools for a few years by then, and we wanted to put all of the experience we’d gained in that time to good use. We decided that the best way to do that would be to write a book together – one that could be accessed by teenagers all over the country, no matter who they were or where they were.

            <div style={{fontSize:"20px",fontWeight:500, textIndent:"30px", textAlign:"justify"}} className="my-4">It felt important to us to make sure that lots of different perspectives and voices went into the book, not only in terms of expertise (our team’s made up of doctors, teachers, activists and academics) but in terms of life experiences too, and the unique combinations of things that make us us. As such, it was a genuinely collaborative effort, and to be honest, we are pretty proud of it! We think that the end result is a positive, practical, and empowering guide for teenagers which tackles tricky topics in inclusive and non-judgemental ways.</div>

                <div style={{fontSize:"20px",fontWeight:500, textIndent:"30px", textAlign:"justify"}} className="my-4">It's made up of nine chapters in total, each of which focuses on a different one of those tricky topics: consent; gender, sexuality and identity; relationships; the body; what is sex?; reproductive health; sexual health; body image; and online life. Across them all, we aim to answer the questions that young people (people of all ages, really!) might not feel confident enough to ask elsewhere.</div>

            <div style={{fontSize:"20px",fontWeight:500, textIndent:"30px", textAlign:"justify"}} className="my-4">Alongside the main text of each chapter, we added in a few other sections too. One of these is the ‘myth versus reality’ boxes, which provide accurate information to challenge some of the common ‘myths’ out there about sex and relationships which often come up in the classroom. There are ‘did you know?’ boxes too, which share fun or interesting facts, ‘tips and tricks’ sections, and ‘consider’ boxes which give extra details to help readers to grasp the ‘bigger picture’. Lastly, the chapters also include all kinds of ‘unembarrassable moments’ where different members of the team share anecdotes about personal experiences, to connect the information to some real-life stories, and to prove that we really are unembarrassable!</div>
            <div style={{fontSize:"20px",fontWeight:500, textIndent:"30px", textAlign:"justify"}} className="my-4">With such a range of topics and features across the book, it really is jam-packed with information, but readers aren’t expected to take everything in in one go. We designed it so that teenagers can dip in and out of the chapters at their own pace, or even just flick through to the different sections as and when they’re interested in learning more. We’ve popped some notes in the back for teachers and parents too, in case they want to use the book to spark conversations with the young people in their lives – it really is for anyone and everyone.</div>
